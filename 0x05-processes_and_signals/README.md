The following projects are for ALX 0x05-processes_and_signals project for the system engineering devops curriculum, inside it contains the following Bash scripts:

* A Bash script that displays its own PID
* A Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes
* A Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process
* A Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash
* A Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
* A Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using kill
* A Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process without using kill
* A Bash script that displays
           -> To infinity and beyond indefinitely
           -> With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
           -> I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
           -> Makes a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead              of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one
* A Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander
* A Bash script that:
           -> Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
           -> Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
           -> Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
           -> Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
           -> Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

* A manage_my_process Bash script that:
           -> Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
           -> In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds
* A C program that creates 5 zombie processes
